# Getting Started

To get started hacking on creditcoin, you'll want to be able to build and run a development node from source.

First you'll need to get set up [building from source](./getting-started/building.md). After that, take a look at [running a development chain](./getting-started/running-a-node.md)
with the `creditcoin-node` you just built from source. Once you have your development chain up and running
[explore your chain](./getting-started/observing-your-chain.md)

and take a look at the various storage items, extrinsics, and other developer tools available in the polkadotJS explorer.

Once you've taken a look around, you can start [learning more about substrate](./getting-started/substrate-resources.md) and blockchains in general.

When you're ready to start hacking on creditcoin, get a sense of the [architecture and repo layout](./architecture.md) to see all of the pieces
we work with and how they fit together.
