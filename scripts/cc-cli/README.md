```

### Rotate session keys of a particular node

creditcoin-cli rotate-keys -u http://localhost:8000
```

### Run the validator setup wizard
This example asumes seeds are saved in `stashseed` and `controllerseed` files and a node is running on `ws://localhost:9944`.

```bash
creditcoin-cli wizard -sf stashseed -cf controllerseed -a 1000 -u ws://localhost:9944

## Local testing for NPoS

You need to have the following:
- `gluwa/hardhat-dev` container to simulate Ethereum
- `creditcoin-node`

    cargo build --release --features fast-runtime
    ./target/release/creditcoin-node --chain local --validator --alice --node-key d182d503b7dd97e7c055f33438c7717145840fd66b2a055284ee8d768241a463 -lrpc=info --enable-log-reloading --pruning archive --base-path ./demo --unsafe-ws-external --unsafe-rpc-external --rpc-cors=all

- Subscan database & Subscan API containers running
- Creditcoin Staking Dashboard running
- Account 0: Private Key from hardhat

Execute like so:

    $ node dist/index.js collect-coins -k 0xAccount0privateKey --seed //Alice --debug
