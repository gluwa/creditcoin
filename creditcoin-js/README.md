# creditcoin-js

## Getting started

### Preqrequisites

Creditcoin-js requires the following to be installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Install

Adding Creditcoin-JS to your project is easy. Install it by using your favorite package manager:

```shell
yarn add creditcoin-js
```

This will install the latest release version, which should allow you to interact with Creditcoin's main network and your own local chains that use the latest Creditcoin binaries.

## Development

### Build

To build the project, run the following command from the root directory:

```shell
yarn build
```

### Updating Type definitions

Creditcoin-JS uses actual chain metadata to generate the API types and augmented endpoints. When the Creditcoin blockchain gets updated and includes new extrinsics or storage fields in itâ€™s pallets, Creditcoin-JS must regenerate its types to include the newly available methods.

1. Fetch Chain Metadata

This process begins with pulling the current metadata from a running creditcoin-node by making an RPC call:

```shell
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"1", "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "state_getMetadata", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9933
```

2. Add Metadata to creditcoin.json

The full JSON output must be saved into a creditcoin.json file as specified by the generation scripts included in package.json.

3. Generate Types

The types can be generated by running the following command:

```shell
yarn build:types
```

## Errors & Troubleshooting

If after following the build process you run into errors where credicoin-js isn't reflecting the changes in the rust code you may need to clear your cache. The following command (run from root directory) can help:

```shell
cd creditcoin-js && rm -rf lib && yarn install && yarn build && yarn pack && cd ../integration-tests/ && yarn cache clean && rm -rf node_modules && yarn upgrade creditcoin-js && yarn install
```
